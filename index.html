        My name is Sarah Fisher. I am the oldest of three girls. My background is in environmental science and high education administration. In my time working at Bellevue College I was 'adopted' by many international students and visiting them gives me a wonderful excuse to travel. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I've always been very focused on environmental issues and science and would like to combine my new coding skills with those long-term passions.
