        Thank you for playing! My name is Sarah Fisher. I am the oldest of three girls. My background is in environmental science and higher education administration. In my time working at Bellevue College I was 'adopted' by many international students and visiting them gives me a wonderful excuse to travel.

      <p>Question 1: Do I have kids?</p>
      <p>Answer: Nope! Although sometimes it feels like I do. From raising kids as a camp counselor, leading student teams at Bellevue College, and my 'adopted siblings' around the world I have plenty of littles to take care of. I now have a nephew and will have a niece next month!</p>
