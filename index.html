        My name is Sarah Fisher. I am the oldest of three girls. My background is in environmental science and high education administration. In my time working at Bellevue College I was 'adopted' by many international students and visiting them gives me a wonderful excuse to travel. 
      </p>

        <h2>I've been to the following countries:</h2>
        <ol type="1">

      <p>
        I've always been very focused on environmental issues and science and would like to combine my new coding skills with those long-term passions.

        <h2>My current Arthur Johnson project and goals:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Book and run more work parties to clear the invasive plant species</li>
          <li>Get the park approved for two or two and a half acres of improved and additional canopy cover</li>
          <li>Write a community petition outlining John's research on park history and our goal to rename the park</li>
          <li>Have a renaming dedication and park reopening party for the community when the forest restoration is complete and the name has been chosen</li>
        </ul>
